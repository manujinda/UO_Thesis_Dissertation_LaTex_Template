We thank Weigang Wu, Jiebin Zhang, Aoxue Luo and Jiannong Cao, the authors of the paper we build our work on. We picked their work not because it is easy to pick on but because they have done excellent work and we thought that their work is worthy of carrying forward.
%We thank Weigang Wu, Jiebin Zhang, Aoxue Luo and Jiannong Cao, the authors of the paper ``Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithms for Intersection Traffic Control'' \cite[]{main}, which we build our work on. Although, in our work, we find fault in their work, our intention is in no way to let their work down. We picked their work not because it is easy to pick on but because they have done excellent work and we thought that their work is worthy of carrying forward. Because we want to make sure that the lives of the people who will one day ride autonomous vehicles driven by algorithms such as the one found on their publication are safe.

\par
We extend our special thanks to Weigang Wu, for corresponding with us via email and helping us acquire a copy of the supplement that accompanies the main paper, which we were unable to locate on-line.

\par
We thank Jeff Magee,  Jeff Kramer,  Robert Chatley,  Sebastian Uchitel and Howard Foster, the developers of the ``Labelled Transition System Analyser'' (LTSA) tool for sharing their code-base with us. Without their generosity, our extension to LTSA, LTSA-O, would have been impossible.
%We thank Jeff Magee,  Jeff Kramer,  Robert Chatley,  Sebastian Uchitel and Howard Foster, the developers of the ``Labelled Transition System Analyser'' (LTSA) tool for sharing their code-base with us, which is otherwise not open-source. It greatly expedited testing our novel ideas and without their kind generosity, the portion of the thesis which extended LTSA would have been impossible.

\par
Jeff Magee is put on a separate spotlight for a big thank you. Despite being a very busy person, he promptly responded in details for our clarifications regarding LTSA and our models.

\par
I thank Stephen Fickas, my thesis advisor, for everything. Without the numerous discussions I had with him, ideas he contributed, time he spent on reading my thesis and providing constructive feedback, and caring he extended toward me as his student, this work would have been infeasible.

\par
I thank C. W. W. Kannangara (13 October 1884 - 23 September 1969), the first Minister of Education and the \textit{Father of Free Education} in Sri Lanka for establishing free education. I further thank all the governments and the general public of Sri Lanka for keeping free education alive for the generations to come and funding my education till I graduated from college. Without this funding, the chances of I coming this far is mere.


\section*{Personal}

I thank Deepa Wathugala, my aunt. During my first term, when I did not get a Graduate Employee position and considering going home without even beginning this journey, she lent me money to pay for my tuition.

\par
My mother, Indrani Wathugala, gave birth to me and raised me to be a good person. She gave me all the psychological support from the other side of the globe. Thank you for everything.

\par
I greatly appreciate my wife, Sharmila Iroshmi Thenuwara. She took all the responsibilities of managing our home on to her shoulder and allowed me to focus fully on my work. She even helped me in my work in various regards such as proof reading and finding articles on the web. She is the best wife a man could ever have. I love you more each day.

My father, Wimal Wathugla, is the ``Higgs Boson'' that glue all the dots together. He was the role model of my life and he taught me to be a good man. In 1957, when he was just 21 years old, he won the second price of a lottery worth Rs. 14,660. Instead of thinking of building a luxurious life for himself, he spent the money for the betterment of his family and to provide a better education to all his siblings including his youngest brother, Wije Wathugala. While my uncle is pursuing his Ph.D., he met my aunt Deepa Wathugala. This connects the dots and that made me survive my first term at the University of Oregon. Dear father, you are getting the returns of your investment in multiple orders and thank you for having a great vision.

\par
Dots in the past are starting to connected well. I am glad about that.
